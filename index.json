However, they are typically unsupervised learning based and unconditioned generative models or simply conditioned on the graph-level contexts, which are not associated with rich semantic node-level contexts. Differently, in this paper, we are interested in a novel problem named Time Series Conditioned Graph Generation: given an input multivariate time series, we aim to infer a target relation graph modeling the underlying interrelationships between time series with each node corresponding to each time series. For example, we can study the interrelationships between genes in a gene regulatory network of a certain disease conditioned on their gene expression data recorded as time series. To achieve this, we propose a novel Time Series conditioned Graph Generation-Generative Adversarial Networks (TSGG-GAN) to handle challenges of rich node-level context structures conditioning and measuring similarities directly between graphs and time series. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-word gene regulatory networks datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed TSGG-GAN.","tags":null,"title":"Learn to generate time series conditioned graphs with generative adversarial nets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Wu","Jing Liu","Penghui Liu","Shanchao Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575244800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575244800,"objectID":"a23c705e8f132e2b809fc38eadd8ac72","permalink":"https://yangysc.github.io/publication/content/publication/wu-2019-time/","publishdate":"2020-07-08T12:13:36.155397Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/wu-2019-time/","section":"publication","summary":"The problem of time series prediction based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) is unresolved. Although many methods have been proposed to cope with this issue, the performance of these methods is far from satisfactory. Traditional FCM-based predictors have three limitations. First, current feature extraction operators are incapable of learning good representations of original time series. Second, current methods use just the output of FCMs to predict the next value; they do not directly utilize the important information of the latent features. Third, current FCM-based predictors optimize each component individually, thereby leading to low prediction accuracy. For example, these methods first optimize the feature extraction operator and then learn the FCMs from the latent features; they do not simultaneously optimize the whole prediction model. In this paper, we develop a framework based on a sparse autoencoder (SAE) and a high-order FCM (HFCM) to address the time series prediction problem; we refer this framework as SAE-FCM. To overcome the first limitation of current methods, an SAE is employed to extract features from original time series. Unlike current FCM-based predictors, our method combines the output of both an SAE and an HFCM to calculate the predicted value, thereby overcoming the second limitation of traditional FCM-based predictors. In an application of the idea of “fine-tuning” in deep learning, the weights of SAE-FCM can be updated by the batch gradient descent method if the prediction errors are great. Thus, we can optimize SAE-FCM as a whole and overcome the third limitation. We validate the performance of SAE-FCM on ten datasets. Compared with the experimental results obtained by using state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results obtained by using SAE-FCM demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments also show that SAE-FCM can effectively overcome the above limitations.","tags":null,"title":"Time series prediction using sparse autoencoder and high-order fuzzy cognitive maps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shanchao Yang","Jing Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525046400,"objectID":"dd5e44a9f7e7851307283914c91dd7c2","permalink":"https://yangysc.github.io/publication/content/publication/yang-2018-time/","publishdate":"2020-07-08T12:13:36.154395Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/yang-2018-time/","section":"publication","summary":"Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have been successfully used to model and predict stationary time series. However, it still remains challenging to deal with large-scale nonstationary time series, which have trend and vary rapidly with time. In this paper, we propose a time-series prediction model based on the hybrid combination of high-order FCMs (HFCMs) with the redundant wavelet transform to handle large-scale nonstationary time se- ries. The model is termed as Wavelet-HFCM. The redundant Haar wavelet transform is applied to decompose original nonstationary time series into multivariate time series; then, the HFCM is used to model and predict multivariate time series. In learning HFCMs to represent large-scale multivariate time series, a fast HFCM learn- ingmethodisdesignedonthebasisofridgeregressiontoreducethe learning time. Finally, summing multivariate time series up yields the predicted time series at each time step. Compared with existing classical methods, the experimental results on eight benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposal, indicating that our prediction model can be applied to various prediction tasks.","tags":null,"title":"Time-series forecasting based on high-order fuzzy cognitive maps and wavelet transform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shanchao Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b1eadd1b5769ae668917409c4176ea47","permalink":"https://yangysc.github.io/project/document-classification/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/document-classification/","section":"project","summary":"Document-Classificationis a model to classify news and documents based on SVM and TF-IDF, giving a result about 81.40% (6109/ 7505) in accuracy.","tags":["NLP"],"title":"Document Classification: Classify Documents Based on SVM and TF-IDF","type":"project"},{"authors":["Shanchao Yang","Jing Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"832c451cc3319ef755a336d5969ef09a","permalink":"https://yangysc.github.io/project/gep/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gep/","section":"project","summary":"GEP is a branch of evolutionary algorithm for modeling time series, which can automatically search for the best model representing the data patterns,similar to current popular neural architecture search(NES) research in deeplearning.","tags":["Evolutionary Algorithm","Genetic Programming"],"title":"GEP: Genetic Expression Programming for Modeling Time Series","type":"project"},{"authors":["Shanchao Yang","Jing Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c2e15d49694e9dfde7e5bfc4ca63acb4","permalink":"https://yangysc.github.io/project/wavelet-hfcm/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/wavelet-hfcm/","section":"project","summary":"Wavelet-HFCM is a hybrid model basedon fuzzy logic and complex networks for time series prediction, achieving comparative prediction results on both stationary and non-stationary time series.","tags":["Time Series Prediction","Graph Network"],"title":"Wavelet-HFCM: Complex Network Model for Time Series Prediction","type":"project"}]
